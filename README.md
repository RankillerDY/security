# Analysis and Integration of Improvements in the Spring Security Project

**Please review the proposed modifications in this README and incorporate the changes if deemed useful.**

This repository contains significant enhancements that have been made to a project using Spring Security. The key modifications include the introduction of DTO classes of the `record` type, optimizations in checking for duplicate users in the database, and a more flexible approach to configuring the secret key.

## Motivation

When analyzing the original project, I identified opportunities for improvements that can be valuable to the project creator and other developers working with Spring Security. The primary improvements include:

- **Usage of DTO Classes in Record Types**: The introduction of DTO classes in the `record` format brings significant benefits such as immutability and code readability. Record types are ideal for representing Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) concisely.

- **Improvement in Checking for Duplicate Users**: In the original project, the checking for duplicate users in the database can be enhanced to avoid data integrity issues. The introduced improvements ensure that there are no user duplicates in the system.

- **Flexible Secret Key**: The secret key, which was previously hard-coded directly in the code as `SECRET_KEY`, is now configured flexibly using the `@Value("${api.security.token.secret}")` annotation. This change not only enhances code readability but also allows the secret key to be configured from external properties `(application.properties)` , making the system more flexible and secure.

## Improvement Details

### DTO Classes in Record Types

The DTO classes have been redefined in the `record` format to benefit from the following characteristics:

- Immutability: `record` type objects are immutable, ensuring that data is not accidentally modified.

- Readability: The code becomes more concise and readable, as standard fields and methods are automatically generated.

### Improvement in Checking for Duplicate Users

Improvements have been introduced in the checking for duplicate users using the newly created method:

```java
boolean existsByEmail(String email);
